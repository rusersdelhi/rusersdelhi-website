      <description>Our small community is almost a year old, and we have an odd 150 members on board. We thank all of you for being an important part. Yes, there has been a prolonged silence from the a few months, but we, the moderators, would like to share a few updates from our end regarding the past, present and future of RUsersDelhi:
The start of this journey🚶 We started laying foundation of this community almost a year back, our first event was on July 14th at the SocialCops HQ and with it we started this journey to learn, share and grow together through this language we all love, R.</description>
